# Plinth UI

## About

Plinth UI is a style-agnostic component library with the hopes of serving as an accessible foundation for other Vue 3 component libraries and design systems.

> Note: This project is in its very early stages. No components have actually been released yet.

## Documentation

Coming soon!

In the meantime, feel free to refer to each individual component's README below.
